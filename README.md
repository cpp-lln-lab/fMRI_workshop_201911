# fMRI workshop november 2019

In the context of an ISPY-funded stay at UCLouvain of Jorge Jovicich, director of the MRI lab at CIMeC-IT, we plan to organise an (f)MRI workshop between November 27 to 29.

Two additional fMRI experts, Christophe Phillips (Ulg) and Hans Op de Beeck (KUL) will also participate in the workshop.

This workshop on (f)MRI will likely be registered as an official course at the FNRS psycheduc and neuroscience doctoral schools. This means that students registered at those doctoral schools could be credited. We are currently working on it.

At the moment we are targeting a 2-3 days workshop with 4 or 5 "modules" (half-days).

The main idea is to cover the main topics of (f)MRI, from data acquisition, signal preprocessing to modern univariate/multivariate analyses. Because the workshop will only be 2-3 days, it does not aim to go into details but the goal is to sketch modern views on how to acquire, organise and process (f)MRI data to solve cognitive/system neuroscience questions. We hope that the course will be suitable for beginners and more advanced users (at least it would "refresh" some concepts in the advanced users). In sum, everyone is welcome, from Msc students to PI.

Our aim is that the workshop will be free of charge for anyone attending.
If interested in participating, please complete [THIS FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8RD_SfuqnvSVCB55CeY9KiA-ALvEV6Hgm9Dy1k37A9jQltQ/viewform) by **Monday September 23rd**. The number of interested people will determine some practical organisational decisions (e.g. the room etc...).

Also, we have a specific question in the form regarding your interest in having a hands-on session showing, in a practical ways, how to organise and handle (f)MRI data based on a pipeline my lab is using/developing. If the number of people interested is sufficient, we will add this session in addition to the theoretical "modules".

People from outside UCLouvain will also be welcome but we first do a quick "in-house" check.

A more detailed email regarding the organisation of this workshop will come later on.

Please feel free to share this information to anyone you think might be interested.
